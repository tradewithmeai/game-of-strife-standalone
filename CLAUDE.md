# Game of Strife - Standalone Edition Development Log

## Project Overview
A mobile-optimized Conway's Game of Life battle simulator extracted from the original multiplayer project. Features both 2-player competitive mode and single-player training mode with comprehensive mobile device support.

## Key Development Session (January 2025)

### Initial Problem & Solution
**Issue**: Countdown component getting stuck at 5/3 and not progressing  
**Root Cause**: `onCountdownComplete` callback being recreated on every render, causing useEffect infinite loops  
**Solution**: 
1. Wrapped callback in `useCallback` with proper dependencies
2. Removed problematic dependency from useEffect array
3. Fixed by removing `onCountdownComplete` from dependency array in SimulationCountdown

**Critical Fix in SimulationCountdown.tsx**:
```tsx
// BEFORE (broken - infinite loop)
useEffect(() => {
  // timer logic
}, [countdown, onCountdownComplete]); // onCountdownComplete changing constantly

// AFTER (working)
useEffect(() => {
  // timer logic  
}, [countdown]); // Only depend on countdown value
```

### Mobile Optimization Implementation

#### 1. Device Detection System
**Files Created**:
- `src/utils/deviceDetection.ts` - Core device detection utilities
- `src/hooks/useResponsive.ts` - React hook for responsive design

**Key Features**:
- Mobile/tablet/desktop detection via user agent and screen size
- Touch capability detection
- Optimal touch target sizing (48px minimum for mobile)
- Adaptive spacing and typography

#### 2. Mobile-Optimized Components
**Settings Screen Transformation** (`src/components/SettingsScreen.tsx`):
- **Before**: 36px buttons, small spacing, desktop-focused
- **After**: 48px minimum touch targets, mobile-first layout, larger icons
- **Key Changes**:
  - Single column layout on mobile
  - Larger touch targets and spacing
  - Responsive text sizing
  - Optimized animations (fewer particles on mobile)

#### 3. Training Mode Implementation
**New Components Created**:
- `src/components/SinglePlayerScreen.tsx` - Wrapper component
- `src/components/SinglePlayerLogic.tsx` - Core single-player game logic
- `src/components/SinglePlayerVictoryModal.tsx` - Training results screen

**Training Mode Features**:
- Solo token placement practice
- Survival rate calculation (% of tokens that survive)
- Performance feedback ("EXCELLENT!", "KEEP LEARNING!", etc.)
- Training tips based on survival rate
- Same Conway's rules but focused on learning

### Architecture Improvements

#### 1. Scoring System Overhaul
**Problem**: Incorrect victory conditions and scoring
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `calculateFinalScores()` to count actual living cells
- Added session-based win tracking across multiple games
- Updated VictoryModal to show both cell counts and session wins

**Key Changes in GameLogic.tsx**:
```tsx
// Proper winner determination based on living cells
let gameWinner: number | null = null;
if (scores.player1 > scores.player2) {
  gameWinner = 0;
} else if (scores.player2 > scores.player1) {
  gameWinner = 1;
}
// null = draw

// Session win tracking
setSessionWins(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  [gameWinner === 0 ? 'player1' : 'player2']: prev[gameWinner === 0 ? 'player1' : 'player2'] + 1
}));
```

#### 2. Menu System Updates
**GameMenu.tsx Changes**:
- Added "TRAINING MODE" button with Target icon
- Renamed "START GAME" to "2 PLAYER BATTLE" for clarity
- Updated App.tsx routing to support both modes

### Technical Stack

#### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom retro theme
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for Android deployment
- **State Management**: Custom hooks (useGameState, useResponsive)
- **Build**: Vite with hot module replacement

#### Key Libraries
```json

  "@capacitor/android": "^7.3.0",
  "@capacitor/core": "^7.3.0", 
  "@capacitor/splash-screen": "^7.0.1",
  "lucide-react": "^0.462.0",
  "react": "^18.3.1",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.11"
}
```

### Game Features Implemented

#### 1. Two Game Modes
- **2 Player Battle**: Competitive Conway's Game of Life
- **Training Mode**: Single-player practice with analytics

#### 2. Conway's Game of Life + Superpowers
**Standard Rules**:
- Birth: 3 neighbors
- Survival: 2-3 neighbors  
- Death: <2 or >3 neighbors

**7 Superpower Types**:
1. **Tank** - Extra durability, harder to kill
2. **Spreader** - Enhanced reproduction abilities  
3. **Survivor** - Can survive harsh conditions
4. **Ghost** - Semi-transparent, special movement
5. **Replicator** - Fast multiplication
6. **Destroyer** - Can eliminate other cells
7. **Hybrid** - Combines multiple abilities

#### 3. Mobile-First UI/UX
- Touch-optimized controls (48px minimum)
- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Device-specific spacing and typography
- Performance optimized for mobile devices

### Data Recording System
**Purpose**: Collect game data for future AI training
**Implementation**: Simplified system recording only essential data:
- Game settings
- Token placements (row, col, player, superpower)
- Final board state and outcome

**Files**:
- `src/hooks/useSimpleGameRecorder.ts`
- `src/services/simpleGameAPI.ts`
- `src/types/simpleGameRecording.ts`
